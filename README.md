# Java Basic Skeleton with Maven, Junit, SLF4J & Logback
Basic Skeleton of a Java (j17) Project with basic 3rd Party Libs (Mvn, Jar Build, Junit5, Slf4j, Logback)

Feel free to just clone/fork/download, change the package and class names and begin your Java work without worrying about the creation/initialization of your project.  
  
    
  
Nothing fancy about this project, this is a simple timesaver, you will find in it:
- Dependencies already configured in the pom.xml  
- logback basic xml configuration with console and file configurations
- Installation plugin, so you can use mvn install to get a jar of your project (with all libs inside the Jar file)


So what are you waiting for ?
Download, use and start coding :-)
